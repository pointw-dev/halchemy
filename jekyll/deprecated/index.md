The early versions of `halchemy` used a more traditional API.  However, as more flexibility and options were added, that API started to become unweildly.  The preferred API now is the fluent approach.

These deprecated methods will continue to live in `halchemy` for a while, but will not be modified.  Please move your client code to the fluent API.
