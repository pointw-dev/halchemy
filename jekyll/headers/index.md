Setting request headers is an important part of working with APIs.  Halchemy makes it easy to set the right headers for each request to your API.
* Manages a set of default headers which apply to each request
* Lets you set headers for individual requests that require unique headers
* Headers are case-insensitive

> All headers managed by halchemy are case-insensitive.  That is, `Content-Type` is the same as `content-type`.  This is handled by halchemy, so you don't have to worry about the case of headers you specify.

This page gives you all the details you need to work with headers in halchemy.
