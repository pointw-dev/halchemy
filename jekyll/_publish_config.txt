  HAL-based Hypermedia API clients for humans.
description: >-
  A simple but powerful library for consuming HAL based APIs.  Create an Api object with the URL to the API, then with a simple approach follow the links from resource to resource, and access each affordance.  Optimized for developer convenience without sacrificing fine-grained control.  An excellent client library for use with hypermea based APIs.  Each supported language follows idiomatic conventions.
