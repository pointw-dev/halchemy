# Deprecated API
::: warning
This API is frozen and deprecated.  Please use the fluent API from 0.9.4 on
:::

The early versions of halchemy used a more traditional API.  However, as more flexibility and options were added, that API started to become unwieldy.  The preferred API now is the fluent approach.

The last version of halchemy that has the deprecated methods is *0.9.3*.  If you must use the deprecated API, you can install that version with:

<tabs>
<tab name="Python">

```bash
pip install halchemy==0.9.3
```
</tab>

<tab name="JavaScript">

```bash
npm install halchemy@0.9.3
```
</tab>
